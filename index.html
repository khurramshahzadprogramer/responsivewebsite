          <h3>TRIP TO LONDON </h3>
          <p>
            When was London founded? London's founding can be traced to 43 CE, when the Roman armies began their occupation of Britain under Emperor Claudius. At a point just north of the marshy valley of the River Thames, where two low hills were sited, they established a settlement they called Londinium.
